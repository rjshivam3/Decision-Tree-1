    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification problems. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features. This process is repeated recursively, creating a tree-like structure of decisions. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n"

    "6. **Prediction**: To make a prediction, the input data is passed down the tree, following the branches corresponding to the values of the attributes until a leaf node is reached. The class label of the leaf node is the predicted class for the input data.\n"
